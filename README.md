nxColor
=======

Color manipulation library written in Haxe.

Currently supports CIELch, CIELab, XYZ, RGB, and HSB color spaces, and will convert between them.
The focus of this library is palette creation - it currently will only blend between colors.

#### Planned Features:
- Addition of more color spaces. (CMYK, etc.)
- Addition of more 'blend' types.
- Other useful color manipulation functions.
- Code cleanup / refactor.
